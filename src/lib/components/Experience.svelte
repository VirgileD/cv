					<div class="detail">
						Awarded <span class="emp"
							>"Senior Expert in Machine Learning, Data integration and Software"</span
						>
						by my company, I joined the Scientific and Technical Direction team of the R&D/Labs departement.<br
						/><br />
						My position is three-folds:
						<ul class="three-fold">
							<li>
								<span class="emp">In charge of the Labs on-premise Infrastructure</span>: the Labs
								has its own hosting infrastructure and compute farm, about twenty host servers for
								the oVirt virtualization solution. Deployment and maintenance of all tools for the
								Labs: shared databases, creation of specialized VMs, Swarm docker for the deployment
								of demo services, GitLab runners, package managers, ... I also help the R&D
								colleagues to use these tools and services.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="emp">Promote innovation</span> by developping tools like the company's
								<span class="emp">Techradar</span>
								or a service to help each BU's Labs entity to manage their
								<span class="emp">roadmaps</span>. I also give internal talks about new trends in
								technology. Lastly I led the acceptance of Rust as the primary low-level language
								for Worldline or a gitlab crawler to ensure secure, consistent and updated design of
								projects.
							</li>
							<li>
								As one of the few engineers in the R&D department which is mostly composed of PhDs
								in CS, <span class="emp"
									>turn proof-of-concepts and even raw material like machine learning models into
									viable, production ready solutions</span
								>. This is my prefered part of the job, when I interact with people to help them
								ship their findings to the real world.
							</li>
						</ul>
						During these 6 years, I strengthen my skills and learned a lot too, from Python to Go, from
						Linux administration to virtualization and cloud, from Tensorflow to Svelte, from Blockchains
						to Quarkus, I jumped happily from one technical stack to another, always eager to learn and
						pass on back my new technical crushes.

						Back from a BigData world, I then integrated the HPC team in R&D where I notably first
						encountered AI.<br />
						In a small team I worked mostly in autonomy, designing and developping several solutions,
						e.g.:
						<ul>
							<li>
								InstantScore: Containerized AI as a service solution with automatic model
								re-training. (NodeJs, Python, MongoDB, redis). Currently used in production for
								fraud detection in Belgium issuing transactions (200K trx/day) and for predictive
								maintenance for French ATMs (helped lower the overall downtime of the fleet by 15%).
							</li>
							<li>
								SmartStream: real-time, lightweight, containerized, multi-languages data integration
								toolkit; it is a pipeline of microservices not based on a message bus (Java, Python,
								ZMQ, Spring)
							</li>
							<li>
								Digital-Signage: rework of an interactive advertising PoC with facial, gender and
								age recognition and customers tracking; redesign of the architecture for
								distributability, switch to more efficient technologies and libraries, rewriting of
								tracking algorithms. Creation of the administration and statistics web service
								(Java, C++, Python, Angular, OpenCv, Cuda, DLib, ZMQ, ...)
							</li>

						I first led the technical side of the creation of the "BI & BigData Business Center".
						With a marketing specialist we interviewed several Business Units Manager to gather
						needs around the emerging topic of BigData and made several proposal for new assets and
						services around the subject.<br />
						This led to the design and development of "DataValueFactory", an advertising targeting tool
						operated as a trusted third party. We gathered from suppliers and partners personnal user
						data that were then cleaned, processed and used to define very precise target for advertising
						campaigns.<br />
						We used, amongst others, the following technologies: Angular, NodeJS/HapiJS for the REST
						API, Spark, Hadoop, ElasticSearch, MongoDB

						After 2 years of managerial functions I wanted to return to a technical position and
						integrated the "Prospective and Emerging Projects" team of the R&D department.<br />
						This team of 5 enthousiast and talented engineers was developping proof-of-concepts and tooling
						services to explore innovative technologies and usages.<br />
						Our key achievment was the design and development of the first OpenData platform of the company,
						"SmartData". After a first proof of concept using OSGi, Java Spring and CouchDB, we switched
						to then emerging stacks: NodeJs/SocketIO, ElasticSearch and MongoDB.<br />
						"SmartData" was kind of an automatic ETL as a service which could ingest, process, store,
						and distribute semi-structured data from a wide range of formats though versatile and open
						APIs.<br /><br />
						While actively developping these solutions I also helped business units in pre-sales activities
						at the innovation side of events.

						I first managed the team responsible for delivering the WebMail part (including the XML

						of 90% of deployments'rollbacks.<br />
						Then I also took responsability for the "Small Clients" business, including ISPs like DartyBox
						or professionals like Allianz, PMU, ... The goal there was to prevent them from leaving,
						which I did by simply restoring a transparent and honest relationship.<br />
						Managed 10 Eng. (plus trainees) - 3.6M€CA<br /><br />
						One of the best parts of the job, though, was to help restoring my teammates self-confidence,
						motivating them to reach their full potential.
